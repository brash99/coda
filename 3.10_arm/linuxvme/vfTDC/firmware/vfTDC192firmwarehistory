Using VETROC PCB, implement it as Flash TDC

The input signals are measured by the 500MHz coarse counter, and precision carry chain delays.
Each channel is implemented using 32 cells ==> 128 taps in the carry chain.  The total delay 
of the 32-cells is a little over 2ns, which gives a natural calibration of the carry chain 
absolute delay (an edge will be measured in consecutive clock cycles).  
Limitation of the firmware: one edge (either rising or falling) in one clock cycle (2ns).

The TDC is saved in the ring buffer, which is about 4us right now.  Upon trigger, the ring 
buffer data is stored in the secondary buffer to be readout.  There should be no dead time
if the time between triggers are longer than the readout window width (no event overlap).

V1.1, July 15, 2014: two chanels are implemented, one chanel per register for readout.
v1.2, July 16, 2014: implement the calibration signals, a simple mux with the real signal.
    The ring buffer (decrease width) and the channel buffer (decrease depth) are changed to 18KB Block RAM. 
V1.3, July 16, 2014: Implement eight channels with a common readout.  Add another 24 channels, and readout 
    through four registers, looping around.  July 18, 2014: Combine the 32-channels into one single FIFO.
	 32-->4-->1. The data is readout properly.
	 Add five more connectors, so the total channels are 192.  Have to compile on Linux-64 
V1.4, July 21, 2014: Add the event (block) formation, readout through VME, not successful
V1.5, July 28, 2014: try to read out through VME.  Decrease to 128 channel, 4K deep buffers.  
    Fix the problem with the evtFinish signal problem in tdcBoard (should be local) for six connector combination.
V1.6, July 29, 2014: Fully scope monitoring, VME A32 readout works.  Compiled for 128 channels.
    July 30, 2014: use VMEreset(5) as the generic reset (syncReset), and VMEreset(4) as ResetDefault
V1.7, July 30, 2014: 192 channel compile.
V1.8, July 31, 2014: fix the problem with single cahnnel readout (order), 192 channel compile

V2.2, Aug. 15, 2014: Sync the Calibration trigger with Clk625 then to the DlyInc 
V2.3, Sept. 4, 2014: try to put in RLOC for Carry Chain, LOC area for each connector inputs with looser BLOCKRAM
V2.4, Sept. 9, 2014: Set ClkVme, extCalib as another two channel-input, used to calibrate the board
V2.5, Sept. 11, 2014: use GENIN(8:3) as six Ext. Calib inputs.  No use, as the Calib logic can only choose one at a time anyway.
    output the divided ClkVme to GENOUT(8:1), so that these can be feed back as normal input pulse (for calibration).
V3.1, Mar. 30, 2015: re-visit the design after six months sitting idle
V3.2, May 26, 2015: change the Locate, so that any carry chains will be limited to a single clock region.
    Change the input mux, so the Calibration is common to all. (only one Calib signal to 32 channels)
V3.3, June 2, 2015: Fix the problem with IN_A and IN_C loc clock region location.
V3.4, June 3, 2015: use V3.3 as guide file, recompile

V1.8, June 16, 2015: Updated UCF file,
V1.9, June 17, 2015: Invert P0Trg1 and P0Reset, use new ucf file, re-shaffle the inputs, it is impossible to compile with SmartGuide.
      June 18, 2015: undo the constraint file (vfTDC_noShaffle.ucf) and disable the SmartGuide. Constrain the buff and Carrychain together
