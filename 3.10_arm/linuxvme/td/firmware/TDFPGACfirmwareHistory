
TDFPGA compile history:

v1.1 Sept. 27, 2012: Copied from TIDFPGA, first compile for TD only.  Removed the MGT, 
	TS function (trigger generation), 
V1.6 Nov. 6, 2012: 4ns timing counter, P2Trg to initiate data generation, data readout
	used for TD production test
v2.1, Jan. 24, 2013: register offset 0x04 default to high, so the optic 
	transceivers are powered up as default, and during FPGA reload (pullup);
V2.2, Feb. 28, 2013: compiled in Xilinx ISE14.4
V3.2, May 15, 2013: Updates the UpDown counters (copied from TIFPGA), so it will not down
	count if it is 0.  Updates the Sync phase alignment (copied from TIFPGA),
	Added the decoding of SyncResetRequest (copied from TIFPGA).  It use VXS P0 DP30 as output.
V3.3, May 23, 2013: Add the connected fiber detections Reg offset 0x04, bits(31:16);
	Disable the TI busy if that TI has requested SyncReset.
V4.1, June 21, 2013: decode the trigger2 with subTS encoding
V5.1, July 29, 2013: use A24 offset 0x100 bit24 to latch the BusyTimer and LiverTimer.
V6.1, Sept. 12, 2013: use A24 offset 0x04 to readout the connected TI status.  (V3.3)
	Bit(23:16): TI powered up, and fiber connected; Bit(31:24): TI trigger enabled
V7.1, Oct. 16, 2013: Change the status decoding, and add the sync code 0xaa (TI ready detection)
	Not backward compatible.  Compatible with TI V15 and later, TS V8 and later.
V8.1, Nov. 27, 2013: Modify the status decoding to match with TI version 17.1
	Add the TI info to A24 registers (offset) 0xD0, 0xD4,..., 0xF0.  Move the original 0xD0 to 0x90
V9.1, Feb. 26, 2014: Add the protection, so that when the TI is removed (software), the TD will not
	mis-identify the TI as ready.
V10.1, Mar. 20, 2014: added the block level acknowledgement from TI.
V10.2, Mar. 24, 2014: fixed a bug in block level readback.  Only fiber#1 was correct.  Fiber#2-7 
	were set to the CrateID.  The corresponding TI firmware is V19.3 (affects TImaster only).
V11.1, Sept. 19, 2014: Adjust the front panel ECL output to be similar as that of TI:
   #1: BUSY, #2: Trigger, #3, 4, 5, 6: A24 offset 0x4c, bit0-3 controlled, #7: reserved, #8: trigger from TS
V11.2, Sept. 23, 2014: Remove the Clk register after the Block counter, and the register after the event, and
   use OFD for the TrgBusy output to SD/TS.  This should decrease the delay and get a consistent timing on TrgBusy.
	Use FDCE for TD trigger input.
V12.1, Oct. 1, 2014: Do the trigger_block counting at 250 MHz clock.
V13.1. Dec. 22, 2014: Add the trigger acknowledge busy enable.  (v12.1 was redone, back to 62.5MHz clock)
       Dec. 23, 2014: set these back to the Clk250 (Trigger Received, Block Received, Block Acknowledged).
V13.2, Jan. 5, 2015: use register offset 0x28 bit 22 to monitor the trigger loss.
V13.3, Jan. 13, 2015: fixed the long time bug that the block level could not be set to an odd number other than 1.
V13.4, Jan. 14, 2015: fixed a bug in Block difference counter.  It should downcount on BlkRcvd, not BlkAckd.
   Use register offset 0x2c bit 31:16 to read the TI busy status
V14.1, Jan. 15, 2015: copy the SYNC decoding from ModTI.  To be consistant with ModTI
V14.2, Jan. 15, 2015: Add the register offset 0x98, number of triggers received on TD.
V14.3, Jan. 16, 2015: Add the extra acknowledge from HFBR check (switch to 100, testpt 3 and 2)
V15.1, Feb. 20, 2015: Use the common sch/VHDL/IPcore design as the TI, TD, TS and TIpcie
V15.2, Feb. 20, 2015: fix the SYNC connection.  SyncSrcEn(0) selects the VXS P0 input, (or else, the TD generation).
   TD trigger source selection: MasterMode (0x2c register set to b"11"), select the decoded trigger.
V15.3, Feb. 23, 2015: Fix the Fiber status detect etc. RxError control
V15.4, Mar. 23, 2015: after MODTIC, TSFPGAC test, recompile for common module compatibility;
   Fixed the PulseTrig signal (too wide), change the front panel BUSY out to the BUSY going to TS

V3.1, Feb. 17, 2016: Incorporate the Changes in TI, and implement the I2C for optic transceivers.
   Use the I2C_busy to delay the I2C read, Set SYSMON Alarm temperature to 45C-42C.
      Feb. 18, 2016: Use the DRdy to validate the SysMon Readout; Enable DEN on SysMon DRP Write.
      Feb. 19, 2016: Use VmeBusy to enable the PData (from PrePData).
		Feb. 22, 2016: Set a timer, so that the SysMon readout would not possibly stuck in not ready.
V4.1, Apr. 7, 2016: Use front panel OT#1 for SyncRstRequst output, to wire to TS Generic Inputs.
V5.1, May 17, 2016: Implement fiber Rx reset (CDR_reset).
V5.2, May 26, 2016: Update with the GtpTilen design, which is similar to X0YnGTP
V5.3, June 13, 2016: Update with the 0xEC register about TI_SyncResetRequestEnable.

V7.1, Apr. 5, 2017: Add the counter check, if there are any cases that the ACK is received, but the SENT is 0. Confirmed.
      Apr. 6, 2017: Output the ROC_ACK to scope: there is NO extra ack, and the extra counter is ZERO too !?
		Apr. 6, 2017: Change the timeing (_N to LOW, _P keep at HIGH)
V7.2, Apr. 11, 2017: Add the 0x170 and 0x174 to readout the non-idle data of fiber#1 and #5 respectively.
      Apr. 12, 2017: Add the TI Buffer_level readback
V7.3, June 16, 2017: Compile as the TI/TImaster changes of the Status decoding/encoding, change the FDC to FDR for acknowledges.
V7.4, Nov. 1, 2017: Propagate the changes in TIFPGAC, using Clk250A for sync with Clk625, updated the ucf file.
      Nov. 2, 2017: Remove the Clk250A, as the phase delay of Clk250 is easier.
		Nov. 15, 2017: recompile the TDFPGAC after TsType changes.
